### Welcome

Welcome to my personal webpage. I work for a small company called Proaxys Labs nebuously in the field of software, and am a
former educator and business analyst who taught at [Columbia College Chicago](https://www.colum.edu/) and worked for [CVS Health](https://www.cvshealth.com/) among others. I'm a graduate from [Governors State University](https://www.govst.edu/) in mathematics and computer science and my personal and professional interests are heavily intertwined.

I am currently working on a tutorial [GF Hello World](https://github.com/jtvisona/gf-hello-world) to add some value to the community by providing a set of tools, scripts, and examples for learning the [Grammatical Framework](https://www.grammaticalframework.org/). GF is an application that allows a developer to quickly build and compile parsers using the GF programming language built atop [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) and using a standard library called the [RGL](https://www.grammaticalframework.org/lib/doc/rgl-tutorial/index.html) which allows one to construct [(somewhat) context-senstive natural language grammars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-sensitive_grammar).

Over the next year, it is my ambition to move some of my Perl, Java, and JavaScript projects into similar repos, and to begin blogging my thoughts on type theory, programming languages, AI, and anything I am thinking about.
