Welcome to my personal webpage. Until recently, I worked for a small company called Proaxys Labs nebuously in the field of software. I am an ISBE licensed educator (PEL 7-12 endorsements in math and CS) and former business analyst for CVS who taught at [Columbia College Chicago](https://www.colum.edu/) and worked for [CVS Health](https://www.cvshealth.com/) among others. I've recently graduated from [Governors State University](https://www.govst.edu/) with my MS in Computer Science having earned a BA in mathematics and a BS in computer science and my personal and professional interests are heavily intertwined.

I am currently working on some tutorials for various languages like the [GF Hello World](https://github.com/jtvisona/gf-hello-world) I started awhile ago to add some value to the community by providing a set of tools, scripts, and examples for learning the [Grammatical Framework](https://www.grammaticalframework.org/). GF is an application that allows a developer to quickly build and compile parsers using the GF programming language built atop [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) and using a standard library called the [RGL](https://www.grammaticalframework.org/lib/doc/rgl-tutorial/index.html) which allows one to construct [(somewhat) context-senstive natural language grammars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-sensitive_grammar).

I, of course, have an interest in the theory of programming languages which is why I'd like to build a series of tutorials, not so much to compete with [W3Schools Online](https://www.w3schools.com/), but to explore how tutorials are best built and used. For instance, I started a [tutorial for typescript](https://github.com/jtvisona/ts-hello-world) also, but know that crafting these tutorials by hand is a dead strategy. To that end, I'm using my python project [Montague](https://github.com/jtvisona/montague) which was developed for further research in [sentiment analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis) 

For now, I'm going to be blogging on [Medium](https://medium.com/@jonathanvisona) about type theory, programming languages, AI, and anything I am thinking about. It's been 3 years since I abandoned Facebook and 10 years since I experimented with blogging and a [personal information management system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_information_management) that includes the use of [Roam](roamreasearch.com). This renaissance of digital productivity is meant to help me further my agenda of acquiring additional expertise in computer science particularly in the [philosophy of computer science (SEP)](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/computer-science/).
